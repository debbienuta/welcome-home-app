# welcome-home-app
This app uses the Norway Open Data to search within a list of GEOJsons of public shelters to find the nearest public home you can go to in Norway, based on your current location.

It is based on my shelter-home-finder app, but also serves as a presentation portfolio. https://github.com/debbienuta/shelter-home-finder

It uses the react particle background component library https://github.com/lindelof/particles-bg. It's very simple to use it.
